## Getting started

Clone the repo and open the site locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vimal-AFK/portfoilo_vimalrajnagarajan.git
cd portfoilo_vimalrajnagarajan
# Open index.html in your browser
# or run a simple local server:
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# or with npm
npx serve .
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 (or the port your server uses).

## Development

- Edit HTML files (index.html, other pages) to update content.
- Edit CSS in the main stylesheet (e.g., styles.css) to change styling.
- Update or add JS in the project's script files to add interactions.
- Use a live-server extension or `npx serve` for quicker feedback.

Suggested workflow:
1. Create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/update-projects`
2. Make edits, test locally.
3. Commit and push: `git commit -am "Update projects section"`
4. Open a Pull Request to merge into main.

## Deployment

This static site can be deployed to many hosts:
- GitHub Pages (recommended for simplicity)
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static web host or CDN

For GitHub Pages:
1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In repository Settings → Pages, set the source to `main` and the root folder (or `/docs` if you store built files there).
3. Save and the site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` or your custom domain.

## Customizing

- Replace text, images, and project links in `index.html`.
- Update color variables and fonts in `styles.css`.
- Add new project cards to the Projects section and include links to live demos / repos.
- Add SEO meta tags and social preview images for better sharing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to suggest improvements:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of changes.

Please keep changes focused and include screenshots or notes if UI is modified.
